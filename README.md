## Design Decisions & Tech Stack
#### Framework: Next.js (App Router)

- Reason: Next.js provides server-side rendering and API routes, allowing for a seamless full-stack experience within one framework.
- The App Router was used to leverage modern React features (such as server components and route handlers) for improved performance and maintainability.

#### API Route (/api/weather)

Instead of calling OpenWeatherMap directly from the client, a Next.js API route (/api/weather) was implemented.

Reason:

- It hides the API key on the server side for better security.
- It simplifies the client-side logic and provides a single endpoint to fetch city weather data.

#### Styling

Clean and minimal styling was applied using CSS modules (or Tailwind CSS if configured).

Reason: Keeps the focus on usability and readability while ensuring a modern look.

#### Units & Measurement

Temperatures are displayed in Celsius (Â°C), as it's the most widely used metric outside of the U.S.

#### Bonus Considerations

- A set of weather-specific SVG and icons (e.g., day_rain.svg, mist.svg) were added for better visual representation.
- The favicon was updated to a weather-themed icon for consistency.
